        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 liter whole milk</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornflour</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>500 ml whole milk</li>
            <li>5-6 green cardamom pods</li>
            <li>saffron</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>finely chopped pistachios</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy bottom pan, boil 500 ml of milk.</li>
            <li>Soak few strands of saffron in a tablespoon of warm milk and set aside.</li>
            <li>Once the milk comes to a boil, lower the flame and continue to stir the milk at regular intervals. After 10 minutes add sugar and mix.</li>
            <li>After 20-25 minutes the milk will thicken to desired consistency, add soaked saffron and crushed cardamom.</li>
            <li>Also add finely chopped pistachios [if using]. Mix and switch off the flame.</li>
            <li>Take out the cooled down rasmalai balls from the fresh water bowl. Squeeze and flatten lightly using your hands and put in sugar syrup for around 10-15 minutes [so that they absorb the sugar] before transferring them to milk. Squeeze the balls carefully as they are very soft and can break easily. I like to flatten the rasmalai at this stage rather than flattening them in the beginning. I feel they get cooked evenly in the sugar syrup when the balls are round in shape.</li>
            <li>Transfer the balls to thickened milk [milk should be warm].</li>
            <li>Chill in the refrigerator overnight or for 5-6 hours. Garnish with chopped pistachios and few saffron strands before serving.</li>
        </ol>
